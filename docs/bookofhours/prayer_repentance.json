I confess that with boldness I dared to defile You Holy Sanctuary with my sins. Now I seek Your mercy and love, for Your mercies are boundless; You never turn back a sinner who comes to You. I confess that that my mind is burdened with sin and that I have no strength left. Do not turn away from me, do not rebuke me in Your anger not chasten me in Your displeasure. I am worn out, have compassion upon me O Lord. Do not judge me according to Your justice, but according to Your mercy. Remember Your creation; Do not put me on trial; because none of Your servants can justify his deeds. Dress me in a new attire that befits Your glory. Forgive me sins and I shall sing \"Blessed is he whose sins are forgiven.\" When I confess my sins, and reveal my iniquities, You cleanse me. Amen."], "ara": ["", ""]}}]}
