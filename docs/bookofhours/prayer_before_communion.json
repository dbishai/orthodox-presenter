                    "O Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under the roof of my house, for I am sinful, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. Say unto my soul, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" I am barren and in need of Your righteousness, Your compassion, Your mercy, and Your love. You humbled Yourself and descended from the heavens and unutterable glory to our lowly state and accepted to be born in a manger. O holy Savior, do not reject my humble and miserable soul, which is waiting for Your glorified coming, but accept to come into my soul to cleanse it.",
                    "As You did not refuse to enter into the leper's house to heal him, please O Lord, enter into my soul and heal me. Do not forbid me from receiving Your holy Body and Your precious Blood. As You did not forbid the women, who was a sinner, from kissing Your feet. May my communion with You banish every defilement and mortify my evil desires. Help me obey Your life-giving commandments, and heal my soul and body from all sins, that I may accept Your gifts. May Your grace dwell in me and may Your spirit abide in me and make me united with You, that I may live for the glory of Your holy name. Amen."
