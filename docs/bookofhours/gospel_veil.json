          "When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by force, to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself alone. And when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.",
          "And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid. But He said to them, \"It is I; do not be afraid.\" Then they willingly received Him in­to the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they were going. ",
          "The day following, the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one which His dis­ciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples were gone away alone. However, there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they ate bread, after the Lord had given thanks."
