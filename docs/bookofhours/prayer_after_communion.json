                    "My heart is filled with joy and my tongue with gladness. My spirit glorifies the Lord, and my soul rejoices in God my Savior. I have come to You, O Lord, clothe me with a radiant garment and make me worthy to enter into Your wedding. Let my communion with You today be forever, for through it, I increase, grow firm in virtue, and am strengthened in faith and in hope. Let my communion be a sign of Your salvation, a raiment of grace, a garment of new birth, purity and righteousness of my body and soul, and preparation for the eternal love and joy.",
                    "I surrender myself, and my will to Your compassion, O Lord, and I call to You my senses and my mind, to bless them and make them according to Your will. Enlighten my heart and awaken my conscience. Disperse all  the shadows of the adversaries. Still the storm, walk with me and guide me. Give me comfort, quench my thirst, and abide with me for the day is coming to an end, and accompany me until daybreak. For You alone are my goal and my joy, now and forever. Amen."
