          "O Lord and Master, Jesus Christ our God, grant us rest in our sleep, repose of our bodies, and purity of our souls, and protect us from the darkness of devastating sin. May the pangs of pain subside, and the heat of the flesh calm down, and the turmoil of the body come to an end. Grant us an alert mind, a humble thought, a life full of virtue, and a pure and undefiled bed.  Raise us up for the night and morning praises, steadfast in Your commandments,keeping in ourselves, at all times, the thought of Your judgments. Grant us to praise You the whole night; blessing Your holy name full of glory and splendor, with Your good Father, and the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver, now and at all times and unto the ages of all ages. Amen."
