Grant me that I may ask and wish always for what is pleasing to You. Let Your will be my will. Let my will follow always Your will and be in accord with it in a perfect way. Let both of us have one will, for I do not want to desire anything except what You want and what You wish. Grant me not to lust for the things of this world, that I may dwell in You in all things and hold above all things the desire to be as You would have me be and to do as You would have me do. You are the peace of my heart and the shelter of my life. You are the real peace and the only comfort apart from You everything is hard and confusing. Therefore, in this peace which is in You, the Great Great Eternal Good, I am able to rest. For Yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen."], "ara": ["", ""]}}]}
