My soul shall boast herself in the Lord: let the meek hear and rejoice. Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.", "I sought the Lord diligently, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fear. Draw near to Him, and be enlightened: and your faces shall not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round about those who fear Him, and will deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man who hopes in Him. Fear the Lord, all you His saints: for there is no want to those who fear Him. The rich have become poor and they hungered: but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.", "Come, you children, hear me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is the man that desires life, and is thinking to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are bent to their prayer: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to wipe out their memorial from upon the earth.", "The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of all their afflictions. The Lord is near to those who are contrite in their heart; and will save the lowly in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but out of them all the Lord will deliver them. The Lord will keep all their bones: not one of them shall be broken. The death of the sinners is evil: and those who hate righteousness will grieve. The Lord will save the souls of His servants: and none of those who hope in Him shall grieve. ALLELUIA."], "ara": ["", "", "", ""]}}]}
