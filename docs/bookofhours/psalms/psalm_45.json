Therefore we shall not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are removed into the heart of the seas. The waters have roared and been troubled, the mountains have been troubled by His might. The streams of the river gladden the city of God: the Most High has sanctified His dwelling. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her face. The nations were troubled, the kingdoms tottered: He gave forth His voice, the earth shook. The Lord, God of hosts, is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.", "Come, you, and behold the works of the Lord, the wonders which He has set upon the earth. Putting an end to wars to the ends of the earth; He will crush their bows, and break their weapons, and burn their bucklers in the fire. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted upon the earth. The Lord God of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
