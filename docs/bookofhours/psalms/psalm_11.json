The Lord shall wipe out every deceiving lip, and every tongue that speaks great words; those who have said, \"We will magnify our tongues; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?\" \"Because of the misery of the poor and the sighing of the oppressed, now I will rise,\" says the Lord, \"I will set them in salvation, and I will be revealed in it.\"", "The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in the fire, proved in the earth, purified seven times. You, O Lord, shall keep us, and shall preserve us from this generation, and forever. The ungodly walk around: accordÂ­ing to Your greatness You have prolonged the lives of the children of men.
