          "Look upon my humiliation, and save me: for I have not forgotten Your law. Plead my cause, and redeem me: revive me for the sake of Your word. Salvation is far from sinners: for they have not searched out Your ordinances. Your mercies, O Lord, are many: revive me according to Your judgments. Many are they who persecute me and distress me: but I did not turn away from Your testimonies. I beheld foolish men, and I suffered; for they did not keep Your words. Behold, O Lord, I have loved Your commandments: revive me in Your mercy. The beginning of Your words is truth; and all judgments of Your righteousness are forever. Glory to You, O Lover of Mankind"
