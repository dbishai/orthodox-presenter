His seed shall be mighty in the earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. Glory and riches shall be in His house; and His righteousness endures forever. To the upright, light has sprung up in the darkness. The Lord God is compassionate, merciful, and righteous.", "A good man is he who pities and lends: he shall direct his words with truth. For he shall not be moved forever. The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. He shall not be afraid of any evil tidings: his heart is ready trusting the Lord. His heart is established, he shall not move, till he shall look upon his enemies. He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever and ever: his horn shall be exalted with honor. The sinner shall see and be angry, he shall gnash his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the sinner shall perish. ALLELUIA."], "ara": ["", ""]}}]}
