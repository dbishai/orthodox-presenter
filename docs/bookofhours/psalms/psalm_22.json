In a place of green pasture, there He has made me dwell: by the water of rest, He has tended me. He has restored my soul: He has guided me into the paths of righteousness, for His name's sake. Even if I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I shall not fear evil things, for You are with me: Your rod and Your staff, these comfort me. You have prepared a table before me in the presence of those who afflict me: You have anointed my head with oil; and Your cup makes me drunk like power. Your mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and my dwelling shall be in the house of the Lord unto length of days. ALLELUIA."], "ara": [""]}}]}
