            "In the minds of the antagonizing Jews, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was surrounded by people, troops, soldiers and warriors, similar to the kings of this world. These were the thoughts of the mother of John and James, the sons of Zebedee. She came to our Savior while He was surrounded by the people and His disciples. She worshipped Him with her sons and said, \"Grant that my two sons may sit one on Your right hand, and the other on Your left hand, in Your Kingdom.\"",
            "Hear then what the merciful and most compassionate Lord, who desires salvation for the whole world said, \"Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\" They said to Him, \"We are able.\" He answered them, \"You will indeed be able to, but to sit at My right hand and at My left is not Mine to give.",
            "It shall be given to those chosen by My omnipresent Father.\" The two brothers were quiet when they heard these words and departed because of the magnitude of His glory."
