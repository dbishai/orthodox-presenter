            "A reading from Nahum the prophet. May his holy blessings be with us. Amen.",
            "God is jealous, and the LORD revenges; the LORD revenges, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves wrath for his enemies. The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.",
            "The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. ",
            "The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that trust in him.  But with a surpassing flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. ",
            "Glory be to the Holy Trinity, our God forever and unto the ages of all ages."
