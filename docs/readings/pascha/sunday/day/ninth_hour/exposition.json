            "O come all of you today, O blessed, pious, Christian, church-loving people, Let us glorify the one God, who, in this week received the sufferings on our behalf for the salvation of our father Adam and our mother Eve, the mother of all the living. On this day, the Lord entered into Jerusalem, together with His disciples. And when He entered, all the city was moved and shaken saying Who is this?",
            "And the great multitudes said, this is the great prophet of Nazareth. Then the blind and the lame came to Him, and He healed them all, and all the children cried out saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! But when the chief priests saw it they murmured saying, what shall we do? And Jesus said to them, Yes. I have you never read in the scripture, Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise? When the infidel and treacherous Jews heard this, they all took counsel to kill Him."
