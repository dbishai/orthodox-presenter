          "Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Hosts (Sabaoth). Heaven and earth are full of Your glory and honor. Have mercy on us, O God the Father, the Almighty (Pantocrator). O Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord, God of Hosts, be with us. For we have no helper in our hardships but You. Absolve, forgive and remit, O God, our transgressions; those which we have committed willingly and those which we have committed unwillingly, those which we have committed knowingly and those which we have committed unknowingly, the hidden and the manifest, O Lord forgive us, for the sake of Your holy name which is called upon us. Let it be according to Your mercy, O Lord, and not according to our sins."
