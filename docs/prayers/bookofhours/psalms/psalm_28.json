          "Bring to the Lord, O sons of God, bring to the Lord young rams; bring to the Lord glory and honor. Bring to the Lord glory to His name; worship the Lord in His holy court.",
          "The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: God of glory has thundered: the Lord is upon the many waters. The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is in great beauty. The voice of the Lord breaks the cedar; the Lord will break the cedar of Lebanon. And He will beat them small like the calf of Lebanon; and the beloved one like a son of the unicorn. The voice of the Lord cuts a flame of fire. The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; the Lord will shake the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of the Lord strengthens the deer, and will uncover the forests: and in His holy temple every one speaks of glory. The Lord dwells in the flood: and the Lord will sit as a king forever. The Lord will give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace. ALLELUIA."
