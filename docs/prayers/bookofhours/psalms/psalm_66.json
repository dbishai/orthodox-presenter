          "God shall pity us, and bless us; and reveal His face upon us and have mercy on us. That Your way may be known on the earth, Your salvation among all nations. Let the peoples, O God, give praise to You; let all the peoples give praise to You. Let the nations rejoice and exult, for You will judge peoples in equity, and guide nations on the earth. Let the peoples, O God, give praise to You; let all the peoples give praise to You. The earth has yielded its fruit. God, our God, shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him. ALLELUIA."
