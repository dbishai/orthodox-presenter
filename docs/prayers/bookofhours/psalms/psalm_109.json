          "The Lord said to my Lord, \"Sit on My right hand, until I place Your enemies under Your feet.\" A rod of power, the Lord shall send out for You out of Zion: and You shall rule in the midst of Your enemies. With You is dominion in the day of Your power, in the splendor of the saints. From the womb before the morning star I have begotten You.",
          "The Lord has sworn and shall not repent: \"You are the Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.\" The Lord is at Your right hand; He dashed kings in the day of His wrath. He shall judge among the nations. He shall fill them with dead bodies, He shall crush the heads of many on the earth. He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore He shall lift up the head. ALLELUIA."
