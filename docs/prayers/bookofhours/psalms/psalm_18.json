          "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims the work of His hands. Day to day utters speech, and night to night proclaims knowledge. There are no speeches or words, in which their voice is not heard. Their sound has gone out upon all the earth, and their words have reached to the ends of the world. In the sun He has set His dwelling; and it comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber: it shall exult as a giant running his course. Its going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and its goal is to the other end of heaven: and nothing will be hidden from its heat.",
          "The law of the Lord is pure, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, instructing the babes. The ordinances of the Lord are straight, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is a light, enlightening the eyes from afar. The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever and ever: the judgements of the Lord are true, and justified altogether. The desires of His heart are chosen more than gold and precious stone, and sweeter than honey and the honeyâ€‘comb. For Your servant keeps them: and in keeping them there is great reward.",
          "Who can understand transgressions? From my secret sins cleanse me, O Lord, and from the attack of strangers spare Your servant: if they do not have dominion over me, then I shall be blameless, and I shall be cleansed from great sin. All the sayings of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, shall be pleasing continually before You. O Lord; You are my helper, and my Savior. ALLELUIA."
