          "O Lord, why have they who afflict me multiplied? Many have risen up upon me. Many say unto my soul, \"There is no salvation for him in his God.\" But You, O Lord, are my supporter, my glory, and the elevation of my head.",
          "With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me out of His holy mountain. I laid down and slept; and I arose; for the Lord is He who supports me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who surround me; who have risen upon me. Rise, O Lord, save me, O my God: for You have smitten all who are enemies to me without cause. The teeth of the sinners You have broken. Salvation is the Lord's, and His blessing is upon His people. ALLELUIA."
