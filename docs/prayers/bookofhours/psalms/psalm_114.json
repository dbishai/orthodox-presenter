          "I loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my supplication. Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call upon Him in all my days. The pains of death grasped me; the dangers of Hades have found me: I found affliction and sorrow. Then I called on the name of the Lord: \"O Lord, deliver my soul.\"",
          "The Lord is merciful and righteous; and our God has mercy. The Lord preserves the infants: I was brought low, and He saved me. Return to your resting place, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you. He has delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I shall please the Lord in the land of the living. ALLELUIA."
