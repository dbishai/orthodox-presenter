Or will You extend Your wrath from generation to generation? O God, You shall turn back and revive us; and Your people shall rejoice in You. Show us Your mercy, O Lord, and grant us Your salvation.", "I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for He shall speak peace to His people, and to His saints, and to those who turned back to Him with all their heart. Surely His salvation is near to all who fear Him; to make glory dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met together: rightÂ­eousness and peace have greeted each other. Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven. For the Lord shall give goodness; and our land shall yield its fruit. Righteousness shall go first before Him; and shall set His steps in the way. ALLELUIA."], "ara": ["", "", ""]}}]}
