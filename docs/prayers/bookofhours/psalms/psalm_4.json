          "When I cried out, God of my righteousness heard me: in tribulation You have made room for me; have compassion upon me, O Lord, and hear my prayer.",
          "O you, sons of men, how long will your hearts be heavy? Why do you love vanity, and seek falsehood? Know you that the Lord has made His Holy One wondrous. The Lord hears me when I cry to Him. Be angry, and do not sin; feel sorrow upon your beds for what you say in your hearts. Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord.",
          "Many say, \"Who can show us the good things?\" The light of Your countenance, O Lord, has been shined upon us. You have given gladness to my heart: they have been multiplied with the fruit of their wheat and wine and oil. I shall both lie down in peace and sleep: for You alone, O Lord, have caused me to dwell in hope. ALLELUIA."
