          "The Lord reigned, let the earth exult, let the many islands rejoice. Cloud and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgement are the uprightness of His throne. Fire shall precede Him, and with a flame shall burn up His enemies who surround Him. His lightings lightened the world; the earth saw, and trembled. The mountains melted like wax before the face of the Lord, before the face of the Lord of the whole earth. The heavens have declared His righteousness, and all the peoples have seen His glory.",
          "All those who worship graven images and boast in their idols shall be ashamed. Worship Him all you His angels. Zion heard and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judea exulted, because of Your judgments, O Lord. For You are Lord most high over all the earth; You are greatly exalted above all the gods.",
          "You who love the Lord, hate evil; the Lord preserves the souls of His saints; He will deliver them from the hands of the sinners. Light has shined for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in their heart. Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous; and praise the remembrance of His holiness. ALLELUIA."
