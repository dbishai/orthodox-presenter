          "I shall make mention of Raab and Babylon, those who know me: behold the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of Ethiopia: these were there. “My mother Zion,” a man will say; and a man was living in her: and the Most High Himself has founded her forever. The Lord shall tell it in the writings of peoples and princes, these who were in her. The dwelling of all who rejoice is within you. ALLELUIA."
