          "Save me, O God, by Your name, and judge me by Your power. O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my soul: they have not set God before them.",
          "For behold, God helped me; and the Lord is the protector of my soul. He shall return the evil things to my enemies; utterly wipe them out by Your truth. I will willingly sacrifice to You: I will confess Your name, O Lord; for it is good. For You have delivered me out of every affliction, and my eye has looked down upon my enemies. ALLELUIA."
