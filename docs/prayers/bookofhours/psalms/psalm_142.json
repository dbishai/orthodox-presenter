And do not enter into judgement with Your servant, for in Your sight no one living shall be justified.", "For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has humbled my life down to the ground; he has made me to sit in darkness, as those who have been long dead. Therefore, my spirit grieves Â­in me; my heart is troubled within me. I remembered the days of old; and I meditated on all Your doings: I meditated on the works of Your hands. I spread forth my hands unto You; my soul is toward You as a dry land.", "Hear me quickly, O Lord, for my spirit has failed; do not turn away Your face from me, or I will be like those who go down to the pit. Let me hear Your mercy in the morning, for in You do I hope; make known to me, O Lord, the way in which I should walk, for I have lifted up my soul to You. Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord; for I have fled to You. Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; Let Your Holy Spirit guide me in the straight way. You shall revive me, O Lord, for Your name's sake; in Your righteousness You shall bring my soul out of affliction. And in Your mercy You will wipe out my enemies, and destroy all who afflict my soul; for I am Your servant. ALLELUIA."], "ara": ["", "", ""]}}]}
