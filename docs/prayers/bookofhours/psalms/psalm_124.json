          "Those who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion: he who dwells in Jerusalem shall never be moved. Mountains are round about her, and the Lord is round about His people, from this time and forever. For the Lord shall not allow the rod of sinners to be upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous might stretch forth their hands to iniquity.",
          "Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their heart. But those who turn to stumbles, the Lord will banish with the workers of iniquity; peace be upon Israel. ALLELUIA."
