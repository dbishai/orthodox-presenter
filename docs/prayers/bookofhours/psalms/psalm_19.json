          "The Lord shall hear you in the day of your trouble, the name of the God of Jacob defend you. He shall send you help from His Holy, and uphold you out of Zion. He shall remember all your sacrifices, and enrich your burnt offerings. The Lord shall grant you according to your heart, and fulfill all your counsel. We will confess your salvation, and in the name of our God we shall grow: the Lord shall fulfill all your petitions.",
          "Now I know that the Lord has saved His anointed: He shall hear him from His holy heaven, the salvation of His right hand is in mighty deeds. These in chariots, and these in horses, but in the name of the Lord our God we will grow. They are overthrown and fallen, but we risen, and set upright. O Lord, save Your king: and hear us in the day we call upon You. ALLELUIA."
