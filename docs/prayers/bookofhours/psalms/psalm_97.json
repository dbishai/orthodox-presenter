          "Sing to the Lord a new song; for the Lord has wrought wonderful works, His right hand and His holy arm, have wrought life for Him. The Lord has made known His salvation; before the nations He has revealed his righteousness. He has remembered His mercy to Jacob, and His truth to the house of Israel; the ends of all the earth have seen the salvation of our God.",
          "Shout to the Lord, all the earth; sing and exult, and sing psalms. Sing to the Lord with a harp, with a harp and a voice of psalm, with directed trumpets, and a sound of a trumpet of horn. Shout joyfully before the Lord King. Let the sea be moved, and its fullness, the world and all who dwell in it. The rivers shall clap their hands together; and the mountains shall exult before the Lord. For He comes to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, and the nations with uprightness. ALLELUIA."
