          "Judge me, O Lord, and avenge my case, against an impure nation: You shall deliver me from the unjust and crafty man. For You are my God and my strength: why have You cast me off? And why do I walk gloomingly, while the enemy oppresses me? Send forth Your light and Your truth: they have led me, and brought me to Your holy mountain, and to Your dwelling. And I will go into the altar of God, before the face of God who gladdens my youth: I will give praise to You with the harp, O God, my God.",
