          "Princes persecuted me without a cause, my heart was afraid of Your words. I will exult because of Your words, as one who has found a great treasure. I hated and abhorred unrighteousness; but I loved Your law. Seven times a day I have praised You because of the judgments of Your righteousness. Great peace let it be for those who love Your law: and there is no stumbling in them. I waited for Your salvation, O Lord, and have loved Your commandments. My soul has kept Your testimonies, and loved them exceedingly. I have kept Your commandments and Your testimonies; and all my ways are before You, O Lord. Glory to You, O Lover of Mankind."
