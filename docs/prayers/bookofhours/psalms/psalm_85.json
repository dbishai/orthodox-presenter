          "Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear me; for I am poor and weak. Preserve my soul, for I am pure; save Your servant, O my God, who hopes in You. Have mercy on me, O Lord: for to You I will cry the whole day. Rejoice the soul of Your servant: for to You, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul. For You, O Lord, are righteous, and gentle; and plenteous is Your mercy to all who call upon You. Give ear to my prayer, O Lord; and attend to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I cried to You: for You heard me.",
          "There is none like You, O Lord, among the gods; and there is none that is able to do Your works. All nations whom You have made shall come, and shall worship before You, O Lord; and shall glorify Your name. For You are great, and wondrous: You alone are the great God.",
          "Guide me, O Lord, in Your way, and I shall walk in Your truth: let my heart rejoice, that I may fear Your name. I will confess You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify Your name forever. For Your mercy is great toward me; and You have delivered my soul from the lowest Hades.",
          "O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of violent men have sought my soul; and have not, at first, set You before them. But You, O Lord God, are compassionate and merciful, longâ€‘suffering, and abundant in mercy and true. Look down upon me, and have mercy on me: give strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your handmaid. Establish with me a sign for good; and let those who hate me see and be ashamed; because You, O Lord, have helped me, and comforted me. ALLELUIA."
