          "Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in my innocence: and trusted in the Lord, I shall not be weakened. Prove me, O Lord, and try me; purify my heart and my reins. For your mercy is before my eyes: and I am pleased with your truth. I have not sat with the vain council, nor shall I enter in with the transgressors. I have hated the assembly of evil doers; and shall not sit with ungodly men.",
          "I will wash my hands in purity, and go around Your altar, O Lord, to hear the voice of Your praise, and to speak of all Your wonderful works. O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Your house, and the dwelling place of Your glory. Do not destroy my soul toge­ther with the ungodly, nor my life with bloody men: in whose hands are iniquity, and their right hand is filled with bribe. But I have walked in my innocence: save me, and have mercy upon me. My foot stood in uprightness: in the con­gregations I will praise You, O Lord. ALLELUIA."
