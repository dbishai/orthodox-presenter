          "I will give thanks to You, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in their congregation. Great are the works of the Lord, examined are all His wills. Majesty and splendor are His works: and His righteousness endures forever and ever. He has made a remembrance of all His wonders: the Lord is merciful and compassionate. He has given food to those who fear Him: He shall remember His covenant forever. He has declared to His people the power of His works, to give them the inheritance of nations.",
          "The works of His hands are truth and justice: all His commandments are faithful: established forever and ever, made in truth and uprightness. He sent redemption to His people: He commanded His covenant forever: holy and fearful is His name. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and understanding is good to all who do according to it. His praise endures forever and ever. ALLELUIA."
