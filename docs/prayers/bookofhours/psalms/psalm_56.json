          "Have mercy upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in You: and in the shadow of Your wings I will hope, until the iniquity passes away. I will cry to God Most High; God who has benefitted me. He sent from heaven and saved me; He gave over to reproach those who trampled on me: God has sent forth His mercy and His truth; and He has delivered my soul from the midst of young lions: I laid down to sleep, while troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.",
          "Be You exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth. They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before me, and fallen into it.",
          "My heart, O God, is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing, and chant in my glory. Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will rise early. O Lord, I will confess You among the peoples: I will sing to You among the nations. For Your mercy has been magnified up to the heavens, and Your truth up to the clouds. Be You exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth. ALLELUIA."
