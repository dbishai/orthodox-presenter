Observe the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to You, O Lord, I will pray. In the morning You shall hear my voice: in the early morning I shall stand before You, and You will look upon me. For You are not a God who desires iniquity; nor shall he who works evil dwell in You; nor shall the transgressors abide before Your eyes: You have hated, O Lord, all who work iniquity. You will destroy all who speak falsehood. A man of blood and deceit the Lord abhors. ", "But as for me, according to the multitude of Your mercy I shall enter Your house: I shall worship before Your holy temple in Your fear.", "Guide me, O Lord, in Your righteousness; for the sake of my enemies, make my way straight before You. For in their mouth there is no truth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have done deceit. Judge them, O God; let them fall down in all their counsels: wipe them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked You, O Lord.", "But let all who hope in You be glad: they shall rejoice for ever, and You shall dwell in them; and all who love Your name shall be proud in You. For You, O Lord, have blessed the righteous: as a shield of favor You have crowned us. ALLELUIA."], "ara": ["", "", "", ""]}}]}
