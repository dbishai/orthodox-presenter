          "I will exalt You, O Lord; for You have accepted me, and not caused my enemies to rejoice over me. O Lord, my God, I cried to You, and You have healed me. O Lord, You have brought up my soul from Hades, You have delivered me from the hands of those who will go down to the pit.",
          "Sing to the Lord, all you His saints, and confess the remembrance of His holiness. For anger is in His wrath, but life in His favor: weeping shall be for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning.",
          "I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. O Lord, in Your will You gave strength to my beauty: but You turned away Your face from me, and I became troubled. To You, O Lord, I shall cry; and to my God I shall make supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust confess to You? or shall it declare Your truth?",
          "The Lord heard, and had mercy upon me; the Lord became to me a helper. You have turned my mourning into joy for me: You have rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; that my glory may sing praise to You, and I shall not be troubled at heart. O Lord, my God, I will confess to You forever. ALLELUIA."
