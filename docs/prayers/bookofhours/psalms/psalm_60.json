          "Hear, O God, my petition; attend to my prayer. From the ends of the earth I have cried to You, when my heart was in trouble: You elevated me up on a rock, You guided me: You became a hope, a tower of power from the face of an enemy. I shall dwell in Your dwelling place forever; I shall be sheltered under the shadow of Your wings.",
          "For You, O God, have heard my prayers; You have given an inheritance to those who fear Your name. Days upon days of the king, You shall lengthen his years to all generations. He shall endure forever before God. As for His mercy and truth, who will be able to seek them out? So I will sing to Your name forever and ever, that I may perform my vows day by day. ALLELUIA."
