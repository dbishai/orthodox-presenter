          "The earth and its fullness are the Lord's; the world and all that dwell in it. He has founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the rivers.",
          "Who shall go up to the mountain of the Lord, and who shall stand in His holy place? He that is pure in his hands, and clean in his heart; who has not lifted up his soul in vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbor. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Savior. This is the generation of those who seek the Lord, who seek the face of the God of Jacob.",
          "Lift up your gates, you princes, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord who is strong and mighty, the Lord who is mighty in war. Lift up your gates, you princes; and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is this king of glory. ALLELUIA."
