          "Blessed is he who thinks of the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in an evil day. The Lord shall preserve him and keep him alive, and make him blessed on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemies. The Lord shall help him upon the bed of his pain; You have made all his bed in his sickness.",
          "I said, O Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against You. My enemies have spoken evil against me, saying, \"When shall he die, and his name perish?\" And if he came to see me, he spoke in vanity; and his heart gathered unto him iniquity; he went forth and spoke in like manner. All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised evil. They denounced a wicked word against me, saying, \"Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again?\" For even the man of my peace, he whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up his heel against me.",
          "But you, O Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, and I shall compensate them. In this I knew that You were delighted in me, because my enemy shall not rejoice over me. But because of my innocence You accepted me, and have established me before You forever. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. So be it, so be it. ALLELUIA."
