          "O Lord, we are not worthy of the least of all Your mercies which You have shown us today. O Lord, rich in mercies, who supports us and fills our hearts with plenty, joy, and happiness, blessed be Your name. O Lord, he who eats, eats to the Lord and gives thanks to God. Therefore, if we eat or drink anything, we do it to the Glory of God and we give Him thanks.",
          "O Lord, let us be hungry for the bread of life, for whoever eats of it never dies but lives forever. Also, let us be thirsty for the living water, for whoever drinks of it shall never thirst, but it becomes a well in him which springs up to everlasting life. WE give thanks, O Almighty God, for these and all Your blessings, through Christ Jesus our Lord. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen."
