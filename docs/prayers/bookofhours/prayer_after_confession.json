You saved me from the valley of destruction, and brought me to the safety of Your bosom. Fill me with hope and faith, for I have come to You as the sick one to his physician, and as the hungry to the Spring of the living water, as the poor to the Source of riches, as the sinners to the Savior, and as the dead to the Fountain of Life; for You are my salvation, my healer, my life, my strength, my comfort, my joy, and my rest is in You. Help me, protect me, and teach me to put my will in Your hands, that I may live according to Your will. Remove my weakness that I may be firm and continue to be faithful ti You until the end. Amen.
