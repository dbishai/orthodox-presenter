Yet, now I come to You, asking to be cleansed from all defilement and filth. Do not reject, but accept me. Look at me with compassion and deal with me mercifully and I will be cleansed and saved; Do not neglect me lest I perish. Grant me grace; That I may approach You with faith and hope, to confess my trespasses and my sins. Enlighten my heart that I may realize my sins, my mistakes and my straying; Grant me determination to forsake evil that I may be established in Your commandments and lie for the glory of Your holy name. Amen."], "ara": ["", ""]}}]}
