          "Blessed are You, O Lord who supported us from our youth and granted us Your blessings, and prepared food for every creature; for the eyes of everyone wait upon You, for You give them their food in due season. You open Your hands and fill all living things. To You is due glory, praise, blessing and thanksgiving for the food that You have prepared for us. Stretch forth Your right hand and bless this food set before us for the nourishment of our bodies. Let it be for power and health of our lives.",
          "Grant salvation, grace, blessing and purity to all those who partake of it. Lift our minds to You at all times to seek our spiritual and eternal food. Grant that we may labor for the everlasting food which is for life eternal. Grant us to be partakers of Your evening banquet. Grant us the food of blessing, the cup of salvation, and fill our hearts with joy. Teach us, since You are the pleasure in all things, that when eating, drinking or laboring, we do it all for the glory of Your Holy Name. For Yours is the glory for ever and ever. Amen."
