O Lord, I beseech Your guidance in this matter. Do not let me follow my tendencies, if it will cause me to be confused and fall. Keep me from slipping, help me, and let it be according to Your will. If You see it fit, grant me Your blessing to complete it. If not, remove this desire from my heart. You know all things, nothing is concealed from You, Lord I am Your servant, deal with me as You see fit, as I realize that I will have neither success nor peace unless I submit myself to Your will. Teach me to say in every occasion, \"Let it be according to Your will, O Lord, and not according to my own.\" For Yours is the kingdom, the power, the glory forever and ever. Amen."], "ara": ["", ""]}}]}
