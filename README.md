# Orthodox Presenter

Orthodox Presenter is an open source web application designed for use in Coptic Orthodox church services. It's responsive in that it can be scaled to fit any screen size. Orthodox Presenter has been designed to run on any device with a modern web browser. It can also be run offline via a local web server. In addition to this, it also loads the appropriate documents for the specific day in terms of readings, saint commemorations, hymns, and other relatable content.
